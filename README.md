DnD Character Creator: SRD Edition

This is a console application for quick character creation for the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons. 
Fumbling through books and PDF's takes a lot of time and there's a significant amount of cross-referencing involving multiple character settings.
Everything your character would have at level 1.

This application reduces character creation to less than 2 minutes and contains the important information you need to copy to your character sheet in one place.

Editing character settings is extremely easy and fast.

2. Race selection: Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, Human, Dragonborn, Gnome, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Tiefling.
