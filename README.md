# DnD-Character-Creator
 

This is a console application for quick automation of character creation for the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons. 
Fumbling through books and PDF's takes a long time and there's a lot of cross referencing involving multiple character settings.

The current scope of this program is currently limited to content under Wizard's of the Coast's open-gaming license SRD5.1.

This application reduces character creation to less than 2 minutes and contains the important information you need to copy to your character sheet in one place.
All character stats are automated and readjusted as you go. Details are provided to aid in decision-making.
